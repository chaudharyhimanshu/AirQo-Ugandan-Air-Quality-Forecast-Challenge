# AirQo-Ugandan-Air-Quality-Forecast-Challenge
This was the competetion hosted on zindi.africa. In this challange we were provided with the metrological data( temperature, precipetation,
atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction) of 5 continuous days and we have to predict the pm2.5 concentration on the 6 day.
There were hugh missing values in the dataset. I used fbphophet to fill the nan.
